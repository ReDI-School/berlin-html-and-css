# Glossary & Terminology

- `Box model` - The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
- `Margin` - The size around the border of an html element.
- `Margin auto-collapse` - If you have two elements whose vertical margins touch, and both margins are positive, those margins will combine to become one margin, which is the size of the largest individual margin.
- `Padding` - The size between the content of an html element and its border.
