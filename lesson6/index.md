ETA: 20 mins

## 2. Form Tags (Part 1)

- There are many tags needed to make a working form. For now, we will cover a few.

### `<form>`

- All forms start with a `<form>` element. It is a container element like `<section>` but for containing forms.
- Two important attributes of `<form>`:
  - action - defines the location (URL) where the form's collected data should be sent when it is submitted.
  - method - defines which HTTP method to send the data with

### `<input>`

- used to create elements that specifically accept data (input) from the user
- There are different types of input elements

  - `<input type="text">`
  - `<input type="email">`
  - `<input type="password">`
  - `<input type="search">`
  - `<input type="submit">`
  - `<button type="submit">Submit</button>`
  - See other input types [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#input_types)

ETA: 25 mins

### `<label>`

- represents a caption for an item
- importance of adding a `<label>` for an `<input>` element
  - A user can click the label to focus/activate the associated input
  - A screen reader will read out the label when a user interacts with it's input
- the `for` attribute

ETA: 15 mins

### `<textarea>`

- represents a multi-line plain-text editing
- Note: This is not an empty element. It requires a closing tag.

ETA: 10 mins

- Task: Show this [image](./form-quiz.png) of a contact form, and let students identify tags to be used for creating it.

  - Take a few mins to explain the concept of Checkpoints to the students and how we are using it to build the Portfolio Project, and ensure they are up to date

- Create a "Contact Me" Page for the Portfolio Project.
  - Students are to create a contact form similar to [this](./form-sketch.png)

# Homework

- Go over everything we have covered for HTML so far. The next class will be on CSS, so make sure you understand what has been taught so far.
- Review your copy of the Portfolio Project and make sure that you are at a similar structure with Checkpoint 6.
- **(Optional) Bonus Lecture - HTML Tags 3** - If you would like to learn about even more HTML Tags to further increase your HTML knowledge before diving into CSS you can take a look at a bonus lecture material we have composed for you. In this [bonus lecture](https://github.com/ReDI-School/nrw-html-and-css-2021-fall/blob/master/teacher/intermediate_lesson5-7/index.md) you are expected to teach yourself different HTML Multimedia tags and other interesting HTML tags and character entities.
