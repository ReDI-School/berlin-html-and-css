# (Bonus lecture) - HTML Tags 3

This is a bonus lecture material containing further HTML tags which go beyond the scope of our CV Project website. Nevertheless, they are still important in the world of HTML and can increase a student's knowledge before diving into CSS.

## Class Agenda

1. HTML Tables
2. HTML Multimedia
3. HTML Entities
4. Other HTML Tags

## 1. HTML Tables

In this section you can try learning about how to do an HTML table without using any CSS. You can learn from the following [resource (W3S)](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp) or [from here (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table). Try teaching this material to yourself by answering the following questions:

- How can we do a table in HTML?
- How do we define the number of rows?
- How do we define the number of columns
- How do we make cell span multiple columns / rows via the `rowspan`, `columnspan` attributes?
- How do we add `<caption>` to tables?

## 2. HTML Multimedia

If you would like, you could also learn about basic HTML Multimedia and how to embed such in their website without the need for using any JavaScript. This section covers. Try finding the corresponding teaching material in W3S or MDN documentation websites and answer yourself the following questions:

- What HTML Multimedia is?
- What are the different and most common file formats for multimedia (e.g. video and audio)
- How to create an HTML `<video>` and what are the attributes we can use there?
- How to create an HTML `<audio>` and what are the attributes we can use there?

## 3. HTML Entities

An important part of HTML are the HTML character entities. Check out what these are by reading more about them [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp). In short, character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML. These include:

- non breaking space
- less than `<`
- greater than `>`
- ampersand `&`
- single quotation mark `'`
- double quotation mark `"`
- and others such as euro, cent, pound, yen, etc.

# 4. Other HTML Tags

This section covers various HTML tags which are less famous but good to keep in mind. Try searching for information about the following tags on the internet:

- `<meter>`
- `<progress>`
- `<cite>`
- `<blockquote>`
- `<bdi>` and `<bdo>`
- `<details>` with `<summary>`
- `<address>`
- `<abbr>`
- `<hgroup>`

# Exercise Description

Exercises should be done along while explaining the tags.

This lesson does not add any new content to our project because the information taught in the lecture does not strictly relate to the CV website.

# Glossary & Terminology

- `HTML Entity` - An HTML Entity is a sequence of characters that produce a single output character in the HTML. Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML. For example, `<` and `>` are reserved characters and a developer cannot put these inside their HTML unless the developer uses an HTML Entity. More on this can be found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp).
- `Multimedia` - Multimedia on the web is sound, music, videos, movies, and animations. More on this can be found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_media.asp)
