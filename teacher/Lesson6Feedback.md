# Teacher Feedback of Lesson 6

## What went well:

- I approached the class in my usual fashion of teach and practical. This i think works well because it gives the teachers an overview of practicals to be done.

## What can be improved:

- The content of the class was too large. Luckily i was able to explain then theoritical wise.
- There was not enough time to practilize some of the stuff taught, such as other html tags.
