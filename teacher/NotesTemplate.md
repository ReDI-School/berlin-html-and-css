(This is a recommended student notes structure. Please follow it and feel free to extend if you feel that you need to. But also make sure to at least contain the following sections.)

(Also keep in mind that these student notes are not a must for how the class should be taught. You as a teacher can choose how to teach the class but also make sure to hand out the student notes, as well.)

> _Recommendation:_
>
> Most classes would require a lot of hands-on knowledge on the actual material. Please make sure to not split those classes into one hour theory and one hour exercise. Instead please try to combine both and do the exercise along teaching the theory
