# Teacher Feedback of Session 24

- Checkpoint 24 is incomplete. There are some comments on the [PR](https://github.com/ReDI-School/nrw-html-and-css-2021-fall/pull/64) that I did not get time to complete before the end of the semester.
  For next semester, we should review the comments and finish the PR if the checkpoint is to be used..
